# ðŸŽ¨ Design Patterns Implementation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains implementations of various **Design Patterns** in software development. Each pattern is demonstrated through practical examples using **Java**.  
**These implementations were developed as part of the Design Patterns course at Ain Shams University during Fall 2024.**

## ðŸš€ Implemented Design Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern**
  - **Directory**: `Adapter_pattern`
  - **Description**: Demonstrates how to allow incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between them.

- **Composite Pattern**
  - **Directory**: `CompositeDP`
  - **Description**: Illustrates composing objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

- **Decorator Pattern**
  - **Directory**: `DecoratorDP` and `DecoratorDP2`
  - **Description**: Shows how to dynamically add behavior or responsibilities to objects without modifying their code.

- **Iterator Pattern**
  - **Directory**: `IteratorPattern`
  - **Description**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

- **Observer Pattern**
  - **Directory**: `ObserverDP` and `ObserverDP2`
  - **Description**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- **Strategy Pattern**
  - **Directory**: `Strategy DP1` and `StrategyDP2`
  - **Description**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

- **Template Method Pattern**
  - **Directory**: `Template_Pattern`
  - **Description**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses, allowing them to redefine certain steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

- **Command Pattern**
  - **Directory**: `commandpractice`
  - **Description**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

- **State Pattern**
  - **Directory**: `state_pattern`
  - **Description**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Java**: All design pattern implementations are written in Java.
